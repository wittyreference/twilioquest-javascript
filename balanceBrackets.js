/* This function works by using a stack to keep track of the brackets. It iterates over the brackets in the input array and pushes opening brackets onto the stack. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if it matches the top of the stack. If the brackets match, the top of the stack is popped. If the brackets don't match, the function returns false.

If the loop completes without finding any mismatched brackets, it means that all the brackets were balanced, so the function returns true.

The function is called with an array of brackets as an argument.
The function initializes an empty stack to keep track of the brackets.
The function begins a for loop to iterate over the brackets in the input array.
The loop checks if the current bracket is an opening bracket ('(', '[', or '{').
If it is an opening bracket, it pushes the bracket onto the stack.
If it is a closing bracket, the loop moves on to the next step.
The loop gets the top element of the stack (the most recently pushed element).
The loop checks if the current bracket matches the top of the stack.
If the brackets match (e.g. ')' matches '('), the top of the stack is popped.
If the brackets don't match, the function returns false.
The loop continues to the next iteration until all the brackets have been processed.
After the loop completes, the function checks if the stack is empty.
If the stack is empty, it means that all the brackets were balanced, so the function returns true.
If the stack is not empty, it means that there were some unbalanced brackets, so the function returns false. */
